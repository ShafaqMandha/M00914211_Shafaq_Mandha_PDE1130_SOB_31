greeting = input("Hello, possible pirate! What's the password?") # Added a double quote to end the input prompt.
if greeting == "Arrr!":
	print("Go away, pirate.")
	'''
		Corrections made:
			- Removed the parenthesis. 
			- Changed "in" to "==" so when the input is == to Arrr!. Then the out given would be Go away, pirate. 
	'''
else:
	print("Greetings, hater of pirates!")
	'''
		Corrections made:
			-	Changed "elif" to "else".
			-	Added a colon after else. 
			-	Intended the print statement after the else statement to follow the proper syntax.
